      <h2>Description.</h2>
      <p>The domplines are a dish of <i>joy for me and any dominican</i>, the texture of the dough and the flavor of the sauce that you put on them is what makes it so dam good for me.</p>
      <p>Esentially, the domplines are just steamed dough that you cover with the sauce of your preference, there are domplines covered in cheese, another in milk cream, another with "Salami guisado" (stewed <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami">salami</a>) So, there are variety of flavors. If somenday you are in the contry i invite you to try it!.</p>
      <p>Although I tell you about a few sauces, in this article I will just concentrate on the <b>"Salami guisados"</b> and the preparation of the dough (this is my mother's recipe). So let's begin with the ingredients.</p>
      <h3>For the dough.</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>1 pound of flour.</li>
	<li>450 ml of milk.</li>
	<li>1 spoon of butter.</li>
	<li>2 eggs.</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon of sugar.</li>
	<li>1 cup of boiling water.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>For the stewed salami:</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Salami. (Try to take one from Dominican Republic, for example, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=salami+induveca&oq=salami+induvec&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBggBEEUYOTIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDINCAQQLhivARjHARiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABKgCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#vhid=xPW8PvDj_SZ0DM&vssid=l">Induveca</a>)</li>
	<li>half of one bell pepper.</li>
	<li>half of one onion.</li>
	<li>half of one cubanelle pepper.</li>
	<li>half of one "sopita". (that's how is called here to a chicken bouillon cube, if you dont find one you can use chiken stock. The amount you want) </li>
	<li>1/2 spoon of concentrated tomate paste.</li>
	<li>water.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now that you know what you need. Let's cook.</p>
      <h3>Steps to cook the dough</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>Heat the water</li>
	<li>In a bowl you goona put the flour, the 2 eggs, the salt, the sugar, the milk, the butter and the boiling water.</li>
	<li>Now, you gonna mix it up ultil you have a sticky dough that is not very liquid or dry, add flour or milk to complete this if you need.</li>
	<li>Put to heat a water pot until it begins to boil, also, add a little bit of salt to the water.</li>
	<li>It's time to put your hands to work!. conver your hands with flour so the dough dont stick to them and star to make balls of dough. (also you cand do cilinders or extend the balls. You are the one that gonna eat it so choose the form that you most like!)</li>
	<li>Put the balls of dough in the boiling water for 45-50 minutes, you gonna know that is cooked when you taste them and the center is not raw. (i mean, that don't taste like just flour)</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Steps to do a salamis guisados.</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>Go and cuts somes slices of salami and cut them in half too.</li>
	<li>Put to fry the slices of salami in a pan.</li>
	<li>While you are frying, slice the bell pepper, the cubanelle pepper and the onion in cubes.</li>
	<li>When the salami colors changes to a darker tone you gonna add to the pan the vegetables that you slice before.</li>
	<li>Add the half of sopita (or a amount of chicken stock) and the 1/2 spoon of concentraded tomate paste to the pan and mix it. Let it cook a little bit before doing the next step.</li>
	<li>Put half of a cup of water to the pan and mix it. After that you gonna let the stew boiling until it have the consistency of a sauce. Taste it, because this is the moment when you have to adjust the salt or put sugar to fix the acidty of the tomate.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>If all go good, my friend, you should have in hands one of the dishes that i most likes and <strong>represent a part of my country</strong>. Now you just have to serve a big bowl of domplines (i mean, the dough) and covers it with the sauce of salami that you made.</p>
